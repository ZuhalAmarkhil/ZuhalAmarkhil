# Welcome to My GitHub Profile! ðŸ‘‹

**About Me:**
<br>
I am passionate about Data Science and Data Analytics, with a diverse background in programming languages, database management, business intelligence tools, and project management. Holding a Master of Science in Information Systems and a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, I bring a strong foundation to any team. I also share my writing on Medium: [My Medium Profile](https://medium.com/@zuhalA).

I'm currently exploring opportunities to apply my skills to real-world projects and make meaningful contributions. Whether it's collaborating on open-source projects or tackling challenging data problems, I'm eager to connect with like-minded individuals and organizations.
